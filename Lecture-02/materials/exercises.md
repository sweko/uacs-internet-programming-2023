# Hands-On Practice

To gain proficiency in working with the DOM, hands-on practice is essential. Here are some exercises to reinforce your learning:

- **Select and Modify Elements:** Create a webpage with various HTML elements and use JavaScript to select and modify their properties, such as changing text content, styles, or attributes.

- **Interactive Forms:** Build a form with input fields and use event listeners to validate user input or trigger actions when the form is submitted.

- **Image Gallery:** Create an image gallery where clicking on an image displays it in a larger view. Use event listeners to handle the image click event.

- **Dynamic Lists:** Build a dynamic list that allows users to add or remove items. Use JavaScript to manipulate the list's content based on user interactions.

## Basic Calculator: Step-by-Step

**Objective**: Create a user-friendly web-based calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations quickly and efficiently.

### Functional Requirements

1. **User Interface**:
   - The calculator should have a clean and intuitive user interface with a display area for input and results.
   - It should include numeric keys (0-9) and operator keys (+, -, *, /) for user input.
   - The calculator interface should be responsive and adapt to various screen sizes, including mobile devices.

2. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - The calculator should support the following basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
   - It should provide a clear and accessible way for users to input these operations.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - Users should be able to input numbers using both the keyboard and on-screen buttons.
   - The calculator should handle decimal numbers and floating-point operations (*homework*).

4. **Calculation Accuracy**:
   - The calculator should provide accurate calculations, adhering to standard mathematical rules.
   - It should handle edge cases gracefully, such as division by zero.

5. **Display and Results**:
   - The results of calculations should be displayed clearly and prominently on the interface.
   - Users should have the option to clear the display and start new calculations.

6. **History and Memory (*homework*)**: 
   - Include a history feature that records previous calculations, allowing users to review and reuse them.
   - Provide memory functions (e.g., M+, M-, MR, MC) for storing and recalling values.

7. **Keyboard Support**:
   - The calculator should respond to keyboard input for numeric entry and operations.
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common functions (e.g., Enter for equals, Esc for clear) should be supported (*homework*).

8. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement error handling for invalid input or operations and provide clear error messages to users.

### Non-Functional Requirements

9. **Performance**:
   - The calculator should be responsive and provide quick calculations, even for complex operations.

10. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**:
    - Ensure that the calculator works consistently across major web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

11. **Accessibility**:
    - Follow accessibility best practices to make the calculator usable by individuals with disabilities, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

12. **Security**:
    - Implement security measures to prevent potential vulnerabilities, such as code injection or data leaks.

13. **User Documentation**:
    - Provide user-friendly documentation or tooltips explaining how to use the calculator's features.

14. **Scalability**:
    - Design the calculator in a way that allows for future enhancements and additional features.

15. **Testing and Quality Assurance**:
    - Thoroughly test the calculator's functionality and user interface to ensure a bug-free and seamless user experience.

*Note*: This set of requirements outlines the fundamental features and considerations for a basic calculator website. Additional features, such as scientific functions, unit conversions, or custom themes, can be added based on specific project goals and user needs.
